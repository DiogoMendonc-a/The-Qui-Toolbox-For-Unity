# The Qui Toolbox
A collection of tools to be used in unity

You can find the zips for download in the Packs directory
Just unzip them wherever you want to use the code
 
The packs come with instructions and in this repository you can find examples of unity scenes that explain them (these scenes are NOT included in the zip files)

## [State Machines](https://github.com/DiogoMendonc-a/The-Qui-Toolbox-For-Unity/tree/main/Assets/C%23%20State%20Machine)
_Mostly finished_ 

A simple yet powerful implementation of state machines

## [Ground Detector](https://github.com/DiogoMendonc-a/The-Qui-Toolbox-For-Unity/tree/main/Assets/Ledge%20Detector%202D)
_Still needs instructions, achange to the folder name and a better example scene. The dectetor itself works fine_

A small tool that allows you to determine whether a given collider is on the ground, on a ledge (and in which direction that ledge is), flying, on a peak, or standing above an hole, using the unity physics system
